# Compiler Warnings

Compiler warnings are the simplest kinds of issues to fix. They're generates whenever your code is built, but they don't prevent your program from successfully compiling and running.

Some of the conditions that can throw a warning include:
* Writing code that never gets executed
* Creating a variable that never changes
* Using code that's out of date (deprecated)

## Below are several examples of warnings.  You will need to address each one so that the yellow triangles disappear.
