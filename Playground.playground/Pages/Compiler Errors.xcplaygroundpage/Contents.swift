# Compiler Errors

Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing syntax are known as compiler errors. This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compiler errors. 

The most frequent Compiler errors are:
 
* Missing Parenthesis
* Printing the value of variable without declaring it
* Variable name is already used
* Type mismatch - cannot convert

Common compiler errors that we will cover later in the course include:

* Scope errors
* Method is undefined
* Invalid return type



## Below there are several snippets of code that contain errors.  You will need to fix each error so that the red error indicator disappears.  Notice how each error indicator is thrown even before you press run.

//Output should display Shondra
let playerOne = "Shondra"
let playerThree = "Jocelyn"
print(playerOne

//Output should be a playerTwo with any name you choose
print(playerTwo)

//Output for playerThree should display Jocelyn
let playerThree = "Mary"
print(playerThree)

//Output should display 0.75
let misType = "3"
let denominator = 4
let mismatch = misType / denominator

## Reflect

Being able to quickly interpret error messages will help you as you progress through this course.  Use this time to reflect on each error and it's corresponding error message.  Write a comment below that will help you remember each error message and it's cause.
