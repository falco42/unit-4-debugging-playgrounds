# Compiler Errors

Errors that occur when you violate the rules of writing syntax are known as compiler errors. This compiler error indicates something that must be fixed before the code can be compiled. All these errors are detected by the compiler and thus are known as compiler errors. 

## The most frequent compiler errors are: 
 
* Missing Parenthesis
* Printing the value of variable without declaring it
* Variable name is already used
* Type mismatch - cannot convert

## Common compiler errors that we will cover later in the course include:

* Scope errors
* Method is undefined
* Invalid return type



### Below there are several snippets of code that contain errors.  You will need to fix each error so that the red error indicator disappears.

###Starter-level Errors

//Output should be 9
let sum = 4 + 5
print(sum


//Output should display whatever you want the score to equal
print(score)


//Output should display 13
let sum = 8 + 5


//Output should display 4
let homeTeamScore: Int = 88
let awayTeamScore: String = 84
let scoreDifference: Int = homeTeamScore - awayTeamScore
print(scoreDifference)


//Output should display 16
let playerOnepoints = 34
let playerTwopoints = "18"
let pointDifference = playerOnepoints - playerTwopoints
print(pointDifference)

Error messages can be ambiguous at first and being able to quickly interpret these error
messages will help you as you progress through this course.  Use this time to reflect on
each error and it's corresponding error message.  Write a comment below that will help you
remember each error message and it's cause.
