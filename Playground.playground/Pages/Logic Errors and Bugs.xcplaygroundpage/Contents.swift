# Logic Errors and Bugs

Errors in the logic of a program (sometimes referred to as semantic errors) can be very frustrating for novice programmers to locate and resolve.

## The most frequent logic errors new coders encounter include:

* Integer division and truncating decimals
* Uninitialized variables

## Common logic errors that we will cover later in the course include:

* Off by one error



### Below are several examples of warnings.  You will need to address each one so that the yellow triangles disappear.
