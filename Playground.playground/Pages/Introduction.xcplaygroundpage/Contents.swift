# Introduction V1
Debugging is a very important skill for developers as you will be spending much of your time debugging code.  It is important to understand the different ways to debug a program, the various error messages that you will see, and quickly identify common bugs.

This playgound is built to let you see different error messages as well as encounter common bugs you will see.  This is only an introduction to common errors and warnings.  We will come back to more complex debugging later in this course.
