# Runtime Errors

Errors which occur during program execution(run-time) after successful compilation are called run-time errors. One of the most common run-time error is division by zero also known as Division error. These types of error are hard to find as the compiler doesnâ€™t point to the line at which the error occurs.

## Below there are several snippets of code that contain errors.  You will need to fix each error so that the red error indicator disappears.
